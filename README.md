Script has only been tested on debian, back up your .zshrc file before running (if you have one)
This script also gives you the option to install flatpak and add the flathub repo, seems completely random but i made this in mind for the shitty chromebooks and their debian VM
# Install 
```
sh -c "$(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/realairacobra/autozsh/main/auto.sh)"
```
